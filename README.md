# Hi, I'm M. Rice 👋
### Aspiring Clinical Bioinformatics Scientist | Genomic Data & Variant Analysis

I am a Genetic Counseling Assistant at GeneDx with a background in Biology and a passion for clinical genomics. I am currently upskilling in bioinformatics to bridge the gap between high-throughput NGS data and patient-first clinical reporting.

- 🧬 **Focus:** Variant Curation (ACMG/AMP), NGS Pipeline Triage, and Data Integrity.
- 💻 **Tech Stack:** Python and SQL
- 🛠️ **Tools:** IGV, UCSC Genome Browser, LIMS, ClinVar.
- 📚 **Learning:** Harvard CS50 Python & ClinGen Variant Pathogenicity.
