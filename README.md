# Hi, I'm M. Rice 👋
### Aspiring Clinical Bioinformatics Scientist | Genomic Data & Variant Analysis

I am a Genetic Counseling Assistant at GeneDx with a background in Biology and a passion for clinical genomics. I am currently upskilling in bioinformatics to bridge the gap between high-throughput NGS data and patient-first clinical reporting.

- 🧬 **Focus:** Variant Curation (ACMG/AMP), NGS Pipeline Triage, and Data Integrity.
- 💻 **Tech Stack:** Python and SQL
- 🛠️ **Tools:** IGV, UCSC Genome Browser, LIMS, ClinVar.
- 📚 **Learning:** Harvard CS50 Python & ClinGen Variant Pathogenicity.

### Bioinformatics-Learning-Journey: Python Scripts for Genomic Data
[DNA Sequence Parser](bioinformatics_projects/dna_parser.py): Python utility for calculating GC content in FASTA files—developed to demonstrate NGS quality control logic.
[Python Data Projects](https://github.com/marinarice/bioinformatics-python-projects)**: Scripts developed during Harvard CS50, focusing on file automation and structured data management.
